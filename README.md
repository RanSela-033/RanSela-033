## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious data scientist in the making, currently wrapping up my degree at the Technion. My projects combine **machine learning**, **data storytelling**, and **real-world impact** — whether it's helping users find the right upskilling courses or analyzing football aggression trends in the Premier League.

I thrive at the intersection of **code, data, and people**, always aiming to build models that are both **accurate** and **interpretable**.
